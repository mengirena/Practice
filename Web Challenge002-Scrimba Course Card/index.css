DESCRIPTION:

You challenge is clone a course card from Scrimba's homepage.

For the layout, you can go grid or flex.

Some extra things to look into:
 - logical properties for margin and padding
 - the new color syntax (for RGB and HSL)
 
 Stretch goals: 
  - Add those fun bubble animations!
  - Create a set of cards where the colors (and other things?) are updated through the use of custom properties
