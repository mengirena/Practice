* Need to **return** the accumulated result while using the `reduce()` array method. 

## Challenge05 - 02/18/21, 02/19/21

```
for (let i=0; i<n; i++){
 //code
}
```

* inline width collapses if there's no content

* vertical-align affects inline only

* can't call method in the event listenter because `this` would be the event. Instead, creating a function with two variables (the first one is the event and the second one is the object) would work.
```
function(e,obj=newBoard){obj.markChoice(e)}
```
