## Lesson learnt

### To get the width, height and the position of an element
-  `Element.getBoundingClientRect()` 
It returns a DOMRect object. It's the smallest rectangle containing the entire element including its padding and border width. It has `left`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height` properties. The result returned is relative to the viewport triggered at that time.
