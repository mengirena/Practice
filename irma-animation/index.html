    <p>At a large field, a mama dog was chained in the middle of it with a few puppies next to them.  Their living condition could only be characterized as horrifying and was unforgettable for reasoned rescuers.  The rescuers wanted to take them all away but they couldn’t as the mama dog belonged to the farmer who owns the field.  He wanted the mama dog to guard his land.  All the rescuers could do was to collect evidence of neglect and maltreatment of these dogs with the hope to report to animal control.  Until one day, the rescuers saw the farmer was beating the mama dog and the puppies nonstop.  The rescuers asked him to stop but to no avail.  The farmer continued with the sound of the puppies’ cries.  They tried to hide behind their mom but since she was chained and probably had endured this kind of beating all her life, she just took it.  It was a scene that broke our hearts – I am sure you understand.  The rescuers saw what they ate – food that was rotten at the farmer’s house.  It was covered in maggots.</p>  
    <p>The rescuers went to animal control and the officers intervened.  The farmer said that he wanted to keep the mama dog to guard his land and he no longer wanted the puppies.  We took all the seven puppies with us.  These poor puppies were terrified of everything and would hide, especially tall people.  As you can imagine, all they’ve known from people ever since their births, was terror.  Because of their fear, we have decided to separate them into different families to help the rehabilitation process.  This is the first time of the rescuers’ 6-year journey of rescuing stray animals, to separate the puppies.  
    After a few weeks of living separately, they started to trust people and love being with people!  It was quite an improvement since their initial rescue.  They love going to dog parks to play with other dogs and socialize.  However, they are still learning to be with people.  They tend to stay away from new people but they show no signs of aggression.  They get along with other dogs in their foster families.  We are certain that these dogs really had helped the puppies’ rehabilitation process and would love to see them going to a forever home that has a dog already.  
    They are house-trained as they could go on the pee pads as well as do their business outside.  They need a family that would be patient and loving, and continues to work with the puppies to rebuild their confidence.  This is very important for dogs that have suffered abuse and neglect.  (Note: The rescuers were finally able to save the mama dog and she is currently safe with one of the rescuers.  However, she suffered so much trauma and her rehabilitation process is long.  She is not available for adoption at this time.) 
    Because we are a rescue organization in Taiwan, the dogs are likely still in Taiwan and you will have to meet your dog(s) and pick your dog(s) up from the airport.  If you are interested in Irma, feel free to contact us and fill out the adoption form on our website.  We will be more than happy to answer any questions.</p>
